Robot Communication
========================
The nodes **Robot Read**, **Robot Wait**, **Robot Write** allow communications with the robot, such as giving them directions to perform a pose.
All three Robot Communication nodes require a robot system to use. You can find the instructions to add a robot system in the Data Source section of each node.
