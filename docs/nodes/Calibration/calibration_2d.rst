Calibration2D node
==========================

This node performs 2D camera calibration and finds the intrinsic and 2D transformation between the camera and the calibration board (chessboard) only using single image capture. 
Also, this node can be used in combination with the HandEyeCalibration2DV02 node in the 2D picking pipeline to perform 2D robot picking.
