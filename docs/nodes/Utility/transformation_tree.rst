Transoformation Tree Node
=============================

This is a utility node that creates a relationship graph of relative positions of objects.
There are two steps involved in using this node. The first step is to define a set of relationships between objects positions and their relative transformations 
then we can query the internal graph to produce a list of transformations as the output.

Input
---------------------

The input can be any number of pose items, each item represents a transformation from one coordinate system to another.
* Object A name: The name of first object, same object much have same name across all pose items otherwise the node will not work properly
* Object B name: The name of second object
* A in B transformation: A pose data representing, A's relative position in B's coordinate system, this input field can be linked with other nodes' output, or you can manually set the pose
All thse pose item will result in a transoformation graph that contains a path between any two objects in the pose items (if such path exist).

Output
----------------------

This node can have any number of output fields. Each output represents a path (combined transformation) from one object to another. You have to set up the name of 
two object in order to get the output. The final output will be a vector of the poses (each generated by one query). The order of output is the same as what appears 
in the user interface

Example
-----------------------

Consider the case where you have transformation from a to b and from b to c, now you want to now the transformation from a to c.

First configure the input (edges) in the transformation tree. Click `Set Inputs` and select a pose item to edit (add or delete item if needed).
Set Object A name, Object B name, A in B transformation. You can click `Set Pose` to manually input a pose. Click `apply` after editing.

Then configure the output. Click `Set output` and select a output item to edit. Simply set the name of two objects and click `apply`.

Then run the node. You should get the expected output. The relative positions of all objects are also shown in the display
