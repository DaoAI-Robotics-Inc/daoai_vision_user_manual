The operator can load dcf files that were generated in the past as the camera output. To do so, the operator should check the Virtual Camera box, and choose the option to load the dcf files. The operator can either load the entire dcf folders or just load a single dcf file. Then press the “Connect” button to connect the camera node with the other node.

To add the real camera, the operator should press the “Updated Camera List”, then press the blank box on the left to discover if the camera’s serial number has been updated. If the number pops up, the operator can select the number by pressing it. The load Setting Path function allows the operator to load the cfg file, which contains the setting the operator configured in the studio to enhance the quality of the image shot from the camera. Then, press the “Connect” button to connect the camera with other nodes.
