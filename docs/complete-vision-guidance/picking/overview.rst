Picking
=========

DaoAI Vision Studio is not only about detecting objects, but also about being able to pick them. While the :ref:`Detection <detection/overview>` page is concerned with what to detect, the Picking page is concerned with everything that revolves around how to pick a detected object: From which points can it be picked? With which tool? Is the pick collision-free?

DaoAI Vision Studio Provide 2 types of picking, it includes 2D and 3D Picking
