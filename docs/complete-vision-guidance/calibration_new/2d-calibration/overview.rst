2D Calibration
==============

Robot-camera calibration is the process where the camera and the robot learn their relative position with respect to each other, which allows the camera to guide the robot to correct positions in the work cell.

Calibration can be performed once the camera and robot have been mounted in the work cell, and needs to be redone if the camera moved relative to the robot base (fixed camera) or flange (robot mounted camera).

~~~~~~~~~~~~

We support two types of calibration, one is accurate for the calibration accuracy, another is easier to use for lower accuracy required applications
