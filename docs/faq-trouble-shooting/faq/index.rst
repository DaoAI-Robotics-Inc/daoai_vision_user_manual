Node Cut Function
-------------------

When you cut and paste a node, the node name will be updated (e.g. node0 â†’ node1). 
All associated node links and expressions in advanced mode will also be updated to the new node name (node1).
No manual changes is required and the workspace would still be able to work as before.
