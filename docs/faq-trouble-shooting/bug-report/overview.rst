How to Report Your Issue
==========
The principle of bug report is to let anyone able to understand the problem and reproduce it easily.

Collect Data
------------
First Complete the following information

#. Software Version. 
    * DaoAI Vision Studio
        .. image:: images/faq-version.png
    
    * DaoAI 3D Camera
        .. image:: images/faq-camera-version.png

#. Phenomenon description.

#. Detailed reproduce steps(Both written and screen recording). 

    .. tip:: If the bug is not reproducible, list all operations before the bug came up.

#. Compressed specific workspace folder. Place all files(dcf, deep learning model&config) required to reproduce the bug in the **Data** folder.

    .. attention:: There might be more than one DMP file generated during a small period of time around when crush happened. Just upload all of them.

Submit Jira Card

#. Open the link to `Jira <https://daoai.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/ES/boards/11/backlog>`_ backlog.
    
    .. attention:: If there's no access to Jira board, then zip all collected data and information and send to any customer support.

#. Go to the bottom of the page, and click **Create issue** in the backlog.
