Language Issue(Possible Workspace Corruption)
================

Since **Vision** has not only English version, we would have issue if the workstation does not support other languages.

On the right botton corner(usually there), click on the ``ENG`` logo to bring up the languages selections.

Select the ``Language Settings`` .

Note: if there is no such logo, you can click ``Window`` key, search Language, and select ``Language Settings`` .

Now the UTF-8 setting on this PC is enable, which can be able to avoid some possible workspace corruption issues.
