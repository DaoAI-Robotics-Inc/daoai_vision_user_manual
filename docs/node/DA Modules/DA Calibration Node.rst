Da Calibration Node
===================

This node has the exact same functionality and settings as the calibration node with the difference that this node does not use the
point cloud for calibration. Therefore, the 3D error of this calibration is not worse that calibration node with RPDepth. However, the 2D projection 
error of this calibration is low.  

Please refer to the calibration node for more details on the similar settings.
