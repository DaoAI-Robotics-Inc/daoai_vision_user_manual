Quick Evaluate
===========
The Quick Evaluate page can be accessed as another tab alongside 'Console' and 'Recipes'. It can be used to evaluate expressions referring to values in the workspace.

Expressions can be added to the evaluation table by selecting one in the 'Available Expressions'. The expressions can be modified once inside of the evaluation table in order to add in an index or map key, such as would be required for expressions containing in [] (vector requiring integer index) or [''] (map requiring string key).

As the flowchart runs, the expressions will be continuously evaluated and refreshed to reflect their changing values.
