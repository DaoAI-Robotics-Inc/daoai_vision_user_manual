Calibration2D node
==========================

This node perfroms 2D camera calibration and finds the intrinsics and 2D transformation between the camera and the calibration board (chessboard) only using single image capture. 
Also, this node can be used in combination with the HandEyeCalibration2DV02 node in the 2D picking pipeline to peform 2D robot picking.
