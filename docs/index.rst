Camera & Robot Calibration
""""""""""
Based on different needs, the system support both the chessboard and sphere calibration modules. Where chessboard is easy to easy and very common in machine vision field. While the sphere calibration is more designed for 3D cameras, where you could simply attach a PingPong ball on the robot arm or place it on the groud.
