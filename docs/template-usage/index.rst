Template usage
==============

Vision does not only detect objects, but also generates the pose for robot to pick them. While the Detection flowchart generates object location, the Picking flowchart consider everything that revolves around how to pick a detected object: Which tool will it use? What pose is robot going to pick it? Is the pose collision free? 
In this section, you can checkout the instructions for all templates. Learning and practising from them.
