Recipes
-------------------

Recipes add a way to easily switch between different IN and OUT (only for definition nodes) values for nodes easily. 
A recipe can contain many different nodes and can be used to quickly switch between workspace-wide configurations, enabling fast and convenient adjustments based on use case. 
The purpose of the recipes are to minimize the effort required by field operator, to a point where total automation is possible,
once they are correctly configured. 
For example, a user can define differnt model to search in different recipes. Then, by switch recipe, the user can quickly change what model to search
without re-doing the configuration.
