Check result  
**********

Users are able to use Quick Evaluate to check the marked variables or values. For example, here we marked variable 3D_Mod_Detection.Detection_Status. We are now able to see the value of this variable is 0. As we execute the flowchart, the value now has changed to 1. If users suspect that the value has not yet updated, users can click on the Re-Evaluate to evaluate the variable again. It is helpful for debugging, easier to check the node outputs and variable values. You can add as many marks as you want.
