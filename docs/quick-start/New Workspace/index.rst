A project(a.k.a. workspace) contains all the component for a workstantion to manage a picking task. Through a workspace operators are able to run 
the picking task with full automation, changing task configuration and view the result of each step. Main page provides entrance to different workspaces.

In this example we are going to create a copy of a template workspace. Select "3D Mod Finder Picking" and choose a directory where you want to save the copy of
the template.
