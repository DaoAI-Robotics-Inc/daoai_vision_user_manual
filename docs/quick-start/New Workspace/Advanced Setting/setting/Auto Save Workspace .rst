Auto Save Workspace 
```````````

This checkbox shows your current Auto-Save status: box checked indicates the workspace will be saved automatically; unchecked indicates the Auto-Save feature is not active. This option cannot be modified before entering the project. Auto-Save feature can be enable/disable within specific project workspace, not at the main page. To see how to enable/disable Auto-Save feature, please see :ref:`3.1.4.2. Title Tab<Title Tab>`.
