The executing menu (#8) has options of how to execute the flowchart.  

i.  Run function is to continuously execute the program, which will not stop unless program encounter errors, waiting for robot response (once the program receive the response will continue running) and manually stop using Pause function. 

ii. Pause function can stop the program from running. For example, if user performs Run for the program, Pause can stop the program. 

iii. Reset function is to reset the program execution flow to its starting point of this flowchart. Resetting the program flow can avoid issues when changing values, links or variables while the program is running to a certain step. The output of the situation might be incorrect or cause error in the flowchart. It is recommended to reset the program flow after any changes to the flowchart. If the current flowchart is child of another flowchart, Reset will reset the program back to the parent flowchart. Note: Reset does not reset any variable values link values, only resets the program execution flow. 

iv. Next Step is to perform execution for one step only. It is useful for debugging. 

v. Skip Step function can skip the next executing step to the its following step. 

vi. Run Selected Step will only execute selected node. 

vii. Run to Selected Step will execute the program to the selected node and execute the selected node itself. 

viii. Exit Interactor can exit the interaction mode.
